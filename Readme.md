# Rimworld - Shale
This is a Rimworld mod that adds a rock called shale to the world. Shale is a pretty common rock (pretty much like steel) both overground and underground and have a fairly generous yield

Shale does nothing by itself, but it can be refined into crude oil, which can be further refined in either plastics or chemfuel.

Plastic is a cheap construction material. Really easy to deal with, but highly flammable and very weak. Doors made of plastic benefits from its lightweight and have increase speeds. Plastic can be further refined into Synthread.

Numbers:
* Each shale rock can be mined for 40 shale
* 10 Shale -> 20 Oil
* 20 Crude Oil -> 25 Chemfuel
* 10 Crude Oil -> 30 Plastic
* 25 Plastic -> 10 Synthread

(This values might need tweaking, fell free to tell me what you think)

Bulk traders should always have some form of shale:
* Tribal caravans have shale
* Outlanders caravans have oil
* Ships should have both

### Future plans/Ideas
(Not sure if these are a good idea or not...)

* (?) Remove vanilla wood and organics chemfuel recipe.
* (?) Shale as a building material
